# 2.2 Vriables (Integers)

## Variable Declarations
* `Variable declaration` declares a new variable specifying variable name and type
* `Integer` is a type that can hold whole numbers
* When a statement that assigns a variable with a value executes, the program puts the value into the variable. The variable will hold that value until the variable is assigned with another value
* Range of integer is -2 billion to +2 billion

## Assignment Statement
* `Assignment statement` assigns variable on left side of `=` with current value on the right side
* `Expression` may be a number

## Assignment Statement with same variable on both sides
* Commonly, a variable appears on both the right and left side of the `=` operator
  * Example: `numItems = 5`, after `numItems = numItems + 1 executes`, numItems will be 6
