# 2.4 Arithmetic Expressions (General)

## Basics
* An `expression` is a combination of items, like variables, literals, operators, and parentheses, that evaluates to a value.
* A `literal` is a specific value in code, like 2
* An `operator` is a symbol that performs a built-in calculation

## Evaluations of Expressions
* Expression evalutes to a value, which replace the expression
* An expression is evaluated using the order of standard mathematics, such order known in programming as `precedence rules`or `order of operations`
  * Parentheses, negation, mult/div, add/sub, left to right


# 2.5 Arithmetic Expression (Integer)

* Commas are not allowed in an integer literal
