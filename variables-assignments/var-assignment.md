# 2.1 Variables and Assignments (gen)

* A `variable` is a named item used to hold a value
* `Assignment statement` assigns variable with a value
  * Example: `x = 5`
  * Means x is assigned with 5, and x keeps that value until assigned again
* Assignment statement left side must be a variable, right side is an expression

## Assignments with variable on left and right
* `=` means assignment in programming, which a variable may appear both left and right sides
  * Example: `x = x + 1`
  * lets say x is 6, then x would be assigned to 6 + 1 resulting in 7
