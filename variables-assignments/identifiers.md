# 2.3 Identifiers

## Rule for Identifiers
* `Identifier` is a name created by a programmer for an item like a variable or function
* Must:
  * be a sequence of letter, underscores, and digits
  * start with a letter
* Identifiers are case sensitive
* `Reserved word` or `keyword` is a word that is part of the language such as `Get`, `Put`, `integer`,

## Style Guides for Identifiers
* Programmers follow identifier `naming convention`, set of style guidelines for naming variables
* Two common conventions:
  * Camel Case: capitalizing each word except the first `numApples` or `peopleOnBus`
  * Underscore Seperated: Words are lowercase and seperated by underscore `num_apples` or `people_on_bus`
* It's all about consisten so code is easier to read
