# 1.3 Comments and Whitespace

## Comments

* `Comment` is text a programmer adds to a program, for it to be read by humans but ignored by the program
* Comments start with a `//`

## Whitespace
* `Whitespace` refers to blank spaces (space and tab) between items within a statement, and to newlines
* Helps improve readability for humans, but execution is ignored
