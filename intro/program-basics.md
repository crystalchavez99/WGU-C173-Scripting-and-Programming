# 1.2 Programming Basic

## First Program
* `Flowchart` is a graphical language for creating or viewing computer pograms.
  * Uses the Coral language, intended for learning to program
* `Program` is a list of statements, each statement carries out some action and executes one at a time.
  * In a Coral flowchart, each statement is in a graphical node with different shapes for different types
* For Coral, an `interpreter` runs a program's statement.
  * `Run` and `execute` are words to carry out a program's statements

## Basic Input
* Programs commonly get input values, then perform some processing on that input and output values to a screen
* In a Coral flowchart, parallelogram represents `input statement`
  * also for output
* To input any value in Coral flowchart, `variable = Get next input`

## Basic Output: Text
* In Coral flowchart, a parallelogram represents `output statement`
* Outputs an item, which item can be a variable or string literal
  * `String literal` consists of text within double quotes
* `Cursor` indicates where next output item will be placed in the output
  * System auto moves the cursor after previous output item
* `Newline` is a special two character sequence `\n` which appears in output string literal which allows cursur to move next output on a new line
  * Appears invisible in output

## Output a variables value
* To output a variable value in Coral flowchart, `Put x to output`
  * No quotes around variable
